feincmstools-demo
====================

Made by `GregTurner <http://github.com/cogat/>`_ for his talk at DjangoCon AU 2013, and previously for the SyDjango Feb 2013 meetup.

Given that `FeinCMS <http://github.com/matthiask/feincms>`_ is cool, how do we make it as easy as possible to use its functionality in our own apps, and to set up our own content models? That is what `FeinCMStools <http://github.com/ixc/glamkit-feincmstools>`_ is for. This project contains a minimal app that demonstrates the chief features of FeinCMS, and how they might be used in a large project. Take a look at the branches for significant stages of development.
